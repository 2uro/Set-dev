well. here it goes,

THIS PROJECT IS STRICTLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
spelling errors aside, what you do with this stuff is up to you, 
wether it be good or evil.
regardless I take no responsibality for your actions.

The purpose of these patches is so that for the time being, the autopwn db functionality of both msf and set can be useable, 
this is just crude patched code, but hey. it works. 
as i find time i will attempt to clean it up, and merge the db.rb file found in the 
Set-dev/framework-4.0.0/msf3/lib/msf/ui/console/command_dispatcher/ dir, with the newest db.rb from msf.

all modificatons made may be found in the autopwn.py file located in set/src/fasttrack/autopwn.py

enjoy, and rember, RedRum RedRum!
